### Welcome to a very broken repo!

These are some of the projects that I worked on that first got me interested in programming. 

Most of these things are broken in some way or another, and none of them are implemented properly, but everyone has to start somewhere. Every project and person can improve, and these old broken scripts are a reminder that I have come a long way.

This is more for data archiving purposes, but if you want to mess around with anything here, be my guest!
