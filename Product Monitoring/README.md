### Product Monitor

This script was written in the middle of the chip shortage when I happened to also be looking for a graphics card. The script would constantly check the Best Buy website for new graphics card listings and email me if it saw the card was available. I would not recommend using this for anything, but there are variables at the top of the checkrtx file that could be modified to scrape any HTML page and check whether it has a certain piece of data in it. 

I did eventually get the graphics card, but this script didn't get it for me. It was more of a buggy mess than a help.
