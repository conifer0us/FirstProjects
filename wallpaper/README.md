### Wallpaper

This was an early attempt to make a dynamic wallpaper that emulates a Linux Terminal behind a Penguin in C Sharp to work with Wallpaper Engine. Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to overlay the images so I decided to remake it in HTML/JS/CSS. It didn't work as expected with wallpaper engine anyway.
