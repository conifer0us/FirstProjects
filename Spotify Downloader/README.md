### Spotify Downloader

I wrote this program to download songs off of spotify to put them on headphones that were not capable of Bluetooth. It is the most scuffed script you have likely ever seen in your life, and it will not serve anyone any use, but it is here anyway.

It of course only works on windows, and it manually plays the songs out of the speakers to record them. 

It does make use of the Spotify API, so you will have to put in a client ID and secret for the script to work as intended.
