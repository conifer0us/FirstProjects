### Pascal's Triangle

This code is an experiment I did with matplotlib to show a friend the efficiency of different means of accessing elements of Pascal's Triangle.

The friend in question, Jake, had an efficient method but not quite as efficient as directly calculating the result using binary expansion.

The code as well as image generated are included.
