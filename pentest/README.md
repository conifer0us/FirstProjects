# pentest

Some files left over from my penetration testing internship (2021-2022). All of the specific information about websites and people have been removed, but these files were all part of a project to obtain an admin password with a phishing email and site clone. The wp-login was a clone of the site's actual wp-login page with additional PHP at the top for logging an obfuscated version of the admin's password. 

There is also a sample phishing email and a script for sending it. This will definitely not work, and it uses PHP, but here it is in all its glory.
