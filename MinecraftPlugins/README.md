# Old Minecraft Plugins

Just some old minecraft plugins when I wanted to do some Dream-like events with some friends on a server I was hosting out of my house. I think the code was impressive for the time that I was writing it, but it was more than 5 years ago at this point. If anyone wants to run these, it's going to require some Bukkit and Spigot nonsense, although not too much adjustment would probably have to be made to run them on a modern server. The Human Flesh one probably warrants some explaining. It was just part of the lore on that server; weird, but ok it's a Minecraft server. There are a few games related to mobs. There's one that just gives some basic commands that minecraft doesn't have by default (I think that's the first one I made trying to figure the whole plugin thing out). There's also one that can just make someone's life in the game a living hell. Ghasts, for example, shoot out some thousands of fireballs instead of one and they do it in all random directions. They usually kill themselves in the process, but I was proud of that one nonetheless.
