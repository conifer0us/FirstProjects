### Mandelbrot

As part of my mathematical and computer science curiosity, I made a python program to generate mandelbrot sets. The program is here as well as a coulple of images generated with it. There's also a file for opening powershell for some reason. Enjoy.

Images are saved to the Images directory with random names, but they open after generation.
