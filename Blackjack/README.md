This was a simple implementation of Blackjack I made when I was first exploring programming. It's been a long time so I cannot vouch for the functionality, but everything seems to work ok. Certainly not an enterprise implementation. 

The staff password has been changed to staffpass. For some reason, I originally used one of my real passwords for this script as I was writing it in plain text. Thank god I checked before pushing all this.
